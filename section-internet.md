The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that allows communication, information sharing, and access to resources such as websites, applications, and services.

It operates through a system of protocols, including TCP/IP, which enable data to be transmitted and received across vast distances. The internet facilitates various activities like online browsing, email communication, social networking, e-commerce, entertainment streaming, and much more. Its decentralized nature means that no single entity controls it, fostering openness, innovation, and collaboration on a global scale.
